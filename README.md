## What I plan to build:

I plan to use the ADS9960 to test the distance. If the distance is very close then RED led will flash. If it returns to the normal distance, the red will not flash anymore,  and the yellow one will turn on.(The details may change if I come up with some new ideas)

## Components I need

Name  | quantity
------------- | -------------
Resistors  | a few
led  | 2
wires  | many


## Questions

I don't quite understand how I should interact with the sensor using C programming now. I think I need some examples to learn from.
